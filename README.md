# extendedmeta
This plugin allows to set additional meta tags for SEO and other purposes in core Joomla! extensions.
### Quickstart

Go to "Extensions > Plugins" and search for `Extended metadata`. Enable it.

That's it. You can set page title different than the article title, and also can have control on other (in future) meta tags in "Create/Edit Article" page.
